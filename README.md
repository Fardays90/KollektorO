Not really a serious thing. I learned about java swing a while back and while learning it decided to make something of my own. This is basically the product of that wish. You basically have to capture the orbs that are falling from the top and you move the left and right cursors using wasd and arrow keys respectively. If you collide with the layer right under the image of the anime character  then the game ends as well so you can't go to the bottom of the screen.
